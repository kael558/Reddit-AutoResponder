## Features

- **Targeted Subreddit Monitoring**: Monitors 15 relevant subreddits including r/webdev, r/smallbusiness, r/entrepreneur, etc.
- **Local Embedding Filtering**: Uses sentence-transformers to semantically filter comments for relevance
- **Daily JSON Export**: Saves leads to timestamped JSON files for easy tracking
- **No Auto-Reply**: Safely monitors without automatically posting replies

## Setup

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Reddit API Setup**:

```

The script will:

	"subreddit": "webdev",
	"author": "username",
	"comment": "Full comment text...",
	"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/...",
	"score": 5,
